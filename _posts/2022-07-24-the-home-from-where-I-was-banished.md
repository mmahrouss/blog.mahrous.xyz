Hello there, miss me, Mr nobody? I sure missed you too! Welcome back to my cocoon

I promised you the story of the home I was once banished from. 

To spare you the details I was once banished from a home, where I was comfortable, somewhat happy, and thought I would stay 
at till the end.

Let's not dwell on why I was banished, as it is not something I can control, so yeah meh it just happened. This is part 
of my life now I am banished from said home that lies in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. Atlantic ocean you say?
Well, you, why do you find that weird, I am a cocoon-dweller who sends you highly metaphorical blogs, just coast along.

So back to the point, I've been banished from said Atlantic home. Sounds sad, eh? Well yeah, it can be  seen as sad, 
hmmm if you expect life to go as we all want it to, regardless of the chaos going around and the intersections and 
divergence of our and other players' expectations, it is highly improbable that things go your way 100%, don't u think?

So if you manage ur expectations and idealism, me being banished is as normal as tidal waves, flowers blooming, or apes 
spanking their bottoms in protest, normal phenomena, nothing interesting 

But you are here expecting a story, or entertainment, or a glimpse into what my soul is going through. You might be granted
 some of your wishes, however; I do not give those blog entries much thought, it is just a normal chaotic stream of 
 thoughts spewed out by a couple of seemingly random arrangements of neurons or whatnot. 

 But yea, ever since the banishment, I have been floating around thru all of the oceans, from the scorching hot, shores of the 
 red seat, to the freezing cold water of the north arctic ocean, it is just me, searching for something that cannot be 
 obtained. But through this search you find what you have been oblivious to, a fragment of the self you will become in the future
 . The future of the banished cocoon-dweller.

 Drowning in your own thoughts and sorrows you discover, but you also free-fall into a pseudo-abyss, but you find a cliff 
 to hang on to, and the cycle continues. But if you play it right, you can slingshot yourself into a good cliff, which from your 
 perspective, is suddenly outside the abyss, but out there, in the manageable heaven that you can realistically obtain. 
 At which you get a chance to get a breadcrumb of enlightenment.

 So it is 2 AM here, the AC is ticking, the couch where I crashed on is comfy and the water bottle is closed, I am presenting
  you with my gist of a random thought, with wrong messy grammar, how it has been so far. I am not in a good state to 
  have a conversation rn, but I can write you this blog because I love you, whoever and wherever you are, I love you, by
   choice, because that energy (however cringy it may seem) keeps me afloat, hanging on to that thing cliff
