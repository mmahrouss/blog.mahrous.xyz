Whoa! That is one nervous Matcha Swirl. 

Okay okay, don't mind the nervous matcha. So why would one choose to take himself with his cocoon and meet others with their cocoons?  

Sounds absurd, doesn't it? However, it is good for your development. The more you meet other cocoon-dwellers, the more 
patterns, and colors you get. It builds you in a different way than staying in your cocoon full-time. 
But what are you going to do with other cocoon-dwellers? Well, my friend, it doesn't matter; you can exchange cocoon
 threads, talk about how the wind made your cocoon fall last week, talk about what parasite pushed your bucket of goo yesterday. 
Maybe even help each other put your goo back in the bucket (okay sounds yucky, bad metaphor sorry)


So next time you are suffocating from black goo, maybe go see some other cocoon-dweller, and get some more colors.

Thanks for reading, come back again, maybe someday I will tell you about the home from where I was once banished.
