![The ephemeral address book](/assets/images/address.jpg)

So you might be asking me: "Hey, wussupp, so why would a cocoon-dweller need an address book?"

To which I would answer: well I don't, but that is how it is, I have that address book of ephemeral addresses. What addresses do I keep there? 

Well, no addresses actually stay in the book, they are ephemeral, however, some blank pages with pen grooves on the paper remain. Anyway, back to
 answering; it actually contains the addresses of all my previous homes. Yes, I live in a cocoon, but that cocoon has
  to hang from somewhere, that is why I am a monad in some sense. I take my cocoon and dwell in many homes, I jump from home to home, I can even stay
  in one home at once.

So why do you leave those homes, don't you feel attached? well, of course, but this is how things are. You can find out this home is not for you, sometimes you are banished, and sometimes you leave for the hell of it. 

Every time I visit a new home, I write down the address, hoping this time the ink will stay, it does not, but that's okay.
Maybe the address book is cursed, maybe if u stopped putting deep grooves of ink you would stay? Well, how can you stay in a place without putting deep grooves on paper? it just doesn't work 

So dear reader, wanna join me on my nomadic adventure? make an ephemeral home together?
