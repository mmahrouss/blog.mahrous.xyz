Hello there, miss me, Mr nobody? I sure missed you too! Welcome back to my cocoon

Yea I kept the line from the previous entry hehe

So it has been two months since we last talked, how are you doing dear? 
I hope you are taking care of yourself, mental health first, remember?   
Oh, where have I been? I have been lost, my dear friend. Ever since the banishment, I have been rolling in my cocoon homeless.

Well, I have been a bit blinded by the idea of my lost home, sometimes I despise it, and sometimes I miss it. But, you know what? 
That is fine, it is a phase I have gone through and probably still going through, let nature take its course. 
The home I have lost is the same as a falling tree on a windy yet colorful autumn day. After the long freezing winter, 
more leaves will grow out.

So, while I was lost in my ocean jungle, I stumbled a lot and got up some days, other days I stayed put. Fine, fine, 
until while I was looking ahead I saw a huge tree with white leaves and pitch black shadows. It called for me. 
I knew then I should follow it.

And here I am taking refuge under the white tree with pitch black shadows. I have set up my cocoon. I can say I am getting 
accustomed to my temporary makeshift home. More importantly, though I can rest after the long walks of being lost. And
 as I have been doing ever since the dawn of my life, I will once again rest, take a deep breaths and focus on my development

Till our next correspondence dear pal (sound weird? but I will keep it). 

Love,   
Your favorite Cocoon-dweller
