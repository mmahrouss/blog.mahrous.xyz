_Here's your tea, son. Hey, are you okay, you look sad?_  
**I am not sad, I am just bored (says I, in a melancholic tone)**

### OOPS I LIED (covers his mouth in a sneaky laugh)

So, hello and welcome back to my cocoon. It is pretty dark and grim in here, sorry about that, but I can't help it (eet eez what eet eez hehe).   
  
  
So earlier today, a parasite just touched _the bucket_, you know how it goes from here, the bucket falls, and all of the black goo inside fills the cocoon, and then it fills my insides, I choke, there is nothing entering my lungs except the black goo. You can feel the goo emanating from my chest(do underdeveloped moths have chests and lungs, well whatever, it is all a metaphor anyway, I cannot do my research anyway, the goo reached my brain)

So let me tell you about that bucket, even since I entered this phase and dwelled inside my cocoon, it has been there, an ever-looming presence. Well, if I am clever enough I can forget it is there and continue doing what I do (what do they do in cocoons anyway?). SO here it is, sitting there, and suddenly a parasite thought or memory or whatever ( well calling it a parasite is not nice, since it is not always a negative trigger, but whatevs) just pushed down the bucket, and the rest is history. 

You might be asking, well you were drowned by that black goo, how are you still alive? Well, first that is just a metaphor dummy, second there are many veins that run to the cocoon walls that enable me to breathe. That is an evolutionary adaptation I developed, probably many ancestors died of black goo suffocation, but yea I got good genes, thanks, evolution master. However, dear Mr evolution master didn't get rid of the pain receptors inside my lungs, so I still feel the same pain as the one drowning, but it passes, however, every time it understandably feels like it is not gonna pass. 

So, now you know about the cocoon and the unstable bucket of black goo, entertained?

So, dear mum, I am not just bored, but I am not gonna tell you. But why son? because I can't, it is hard to connect, why? idk, mum, that is how it is.  
So excuse me, mum, I have some black goo to put away in its bucket so it falls properly next time, just me setting up my own trap, but is there another way?
