So let me set the scene, it's dark and melancholic, you are engulfed in ur cocoon, the parasite is eating you, 
the bucket is very close to tipping, you have been banished from all you're previous homes, and you've set up your cocoon
in a place that does not exist. I do not know what I want to say in this entry, to be honest, I do not have an idea 
in my mind like the last few entries, so it will feel a bit out of place.  

So you want to escape, you wanna set up camp in a place where the sunlight can reliably hit you. However, you gotta be
 patient your escape will come. However, you won't listen to me, no one does, you will try to rush, then you are caught 
 up in the eye of the storm. Do you know what the eye of a storm is? Well, I did not know either, until I recently read it 
 in some short story. It is like that calm spot in the middle of a typhoon/hurricane, where the weather is good
 it is calm in the midst of chaos. Just be patient, don't get overwhelmed by the eye, the storm will go away, and then you
 will be out. You will find your lasting address for a home in which you can dwell for sometime and enjoy sunshine, 
 just don't forget to put on sunscreen
