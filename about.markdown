Hi my name is Mohamed Mahrous, I am a software engineer at Gig.tech. However, this is not a tech blog  

This is a personal blog, I am using it to process my life and thoughts. It is a method to make me articulate what I
 am going through and help me pour myself out and help me heal from pains and losses of our beloved lives.
